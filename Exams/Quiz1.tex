  \item

    We may begin by finding the energy:

    $$E_{\infty}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{-T}^T |x(t)|^2\,dt$$

    Since the signal is finite, we have a nonzero value only for $0\leq t\leq 1$. Therefore, we may write:

    $$E_{\infty}=\int_{0}^1 |e^t|^2\,dt$$
    $$E_{\infty}=\int_{0}^1 e^{2t}\,dt$$
    $$E_{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}e^{2t}\Big_0^1$$
    $$\boxed{E_{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}e^{2}-\frac{1}{2}}$$

    We then find the power:

    $$P_{\infty}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{E_{\infty}}{2T}$$
    $$\boxed{P_{\infty}=0}$$

    Therefore, because energy is finite and power is 0, then \underline{this is an energy signal}

        \end{figure}

      \item For $x\left( -\frac{t}{2}+2 \right)$:

        \vspace{-20pt}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \include{Figures/Q1P2b}
          \caption{Plot for $x\left( -\frac{t}{2}+2 \right)$}
          \label{fig:2}
        \end{figure}

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\Roman*}.]

      \item We begin by finding whether the individual sinusoids are periodic:

        $$N_1\to \frac{2\pi}{\frac{4\pi}{5}}\to \frac{5}{2}m\to 5$$
        $$N_2\to \frac{2\pi}{\frac{5\pi}{7}}\to \frac{14}{5}m\to 14$$

        Thus, we see both are, individually, periodic.

        We then find the least common factor between the two signals, which comes out to be:

        $$N_o=aN_1+bN_2\to N_1N_2$$
        $$\boxed{N_o=70}$$

      \item From the signal, we see that the leading term is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n$. Since this is a geometric, decaying series, the signal must converge. Therefore, \underline{the signal is \textbf{not} periodic}
