    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We begin by taking the Laplace transform to get:

        $$H(s)=-\frac{1}{s-1}\quad\text{ and }\quad X(s)=\frac{2}{s}\left[  e^{-s}-e^{-2s}\right]$$

        We then multiply the two to get:

        $$Y(s)=X(s)H(s)$$
        $$Y(s)=-\frac{2}{s(s-1)}\left[ e^{-s}-e^{-2s} \right]$$

        Using partial fraction decomposition, we may write the equivalent such that:

        $$-\frac{2}{s(s-1)}=\frac{A}{s-1}+\frac{B}{s}=As+B(s-1)$$

        We use $s=0,1$ to get:

        $$A=-2,\,B=2\to -\frac{2}{s-1}+\frac{2}{s}$$

        We now distribute this in the above case to get:

        $$Y(s)=-\frac{2}{s-1}\left[ e^{-s}-e^{-2s} \right]+\frac{2}{s}\left[ e^{-s}-e^{-2s} \right]$$
        $$Y(s)=-\frac{2e^{-s}}{s-1}+\frac{2e^{-2s}}{s-1}+\frac{2e^{-s}}{s}-\frac{2e^{-2s}}{s}$$

        Finally, we take the inverse transform to get:

        $$\boxed{y(t)=-2u(1-t)+2e^{t-1}u(1-t)+2u(2-t)-2e^{t-2}u(2-t)}$$

      \item 

        Differentiating one of the inputs is the same as differentiating the output. Thus, we may say:

        $$g(t)=\frac{d}{dt}[y(t)]$$
        $$\boxed{g(t)=2e^{t-1}u(1-t)-2e^{t-2}u(2-t)}$$

      \item As stated in (b) \underline{$g(t)=(d/dt)[y(t)]$}

      \item $z(t)$ is the same as $g(t)$. Since taking the differential is a linear operation, it does not matter if this is done to the impulse response or to $x(t)$. Therefore, we get:

      \item By linearity of the transform, we may say:

        $$y_1(t)=2y(t-1)$$

        Therefore, we may obtain:

        $$\boxed{y_1(t)=-4u(2-t)+4e^{t-2}u(2-t)+4u(3-t)-4e^{t-3}u(3-t)}$$
