\begin{itemize}

  \item A periodic signal, $x(t)$, with period $T_o$ can be expressed as a sum of complex exponentials at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics. The analysis equation may be written as:

    $$X(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-j\omega t}\,dt$$

  \item The synthesis equation may be written as:

    $$x(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(\omega)e^{j\omega t}\,d\omega$$

  \item The Fourier Transform exists only if the $j\omega$ axis lies within the ROC of the Laplace Transform

  \item Fourier Transforms are governed by the Dirichlet conditions:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item $x(t)$ is absolutely integrable

      \item $x(t)$ has a finite number of maxima and minima over any finite interval

      \item $x(t)$ has a finite number of finite discontinuities over any finite interval

      \item Note: Periodic signals do not satisfy these conditions but are considered to have Fourier transforms if impulse functions are included in the Fourier representation

    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
